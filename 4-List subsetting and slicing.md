# **Python List Subsetting & Slicing**

## **1. Subsetting Lists**

### **Introduction to List Subsetting**
After creating a list in Python, you often need to access specific elements from it. Python uses **indexing** to achieve this.

#### **List Indexing**
- The first element in a list has an index of `0`.
- The second element has an index of `1`, and so on.
- **Example List**:  
  `fam = ["dad", 1.80, "mom", 1.68, "emma", 1.75, "brother", 1.72]`
  - To access "emma's" height (which is `1.68`), we use the index `3`:
    ```python
    fam[3]  # Output: 1.68
    ```

#### **Accessing Other Elements by Index**
- To access the string `"dad"`, which is the first element, use the index `0`:
  ```python
  fam[0]  # Output: "dad"
  ```

### **Negative Indexing**
Python also allows **negative indexing**, which is useful for accessing elements from the end of the list.

- **Index -1** refers to the last element.
- **Index -2** refers to the second-last element, and so on.

#### **Example of Negative Indexing**
- To access your dadâ€™s height (the last element in the list), you can use the index `-1`:
  ```python
  fam[-1]  # Output: 1.72
  ```
- **Indexing from the end** is helpful when you don't know the exact length of the list.

## **2. List Slicing**

### **What is List Slicing?**
List slicing allows you to select multiple elements from a list by specifying a **range** of indices. This creates a new list.

#### **List Slicing Syntax**
```python
list[start:end]
```
- `start`: The index where the slice starts (inclusive).
- `end`: The index where the slice ends (exclusive).

### **Slicing Example**
- **Given List**:  
  `fam = ["dad", 1.80, "mom", 1.68, "emma", 1.75, "brother", 1.72]`
- To slice out the elements with indices 3, 4, and 5 (which are `"1.68"`, `"mom"`, and `"1.71"`):
  ```python
  fam[3:5]  # Output: [1.68, "mom"]
  ```
  - **Note**: The element at index `5` is not included.

#### **Detailed Explanation of Slicing Behavior**
- The element at the `start` index is **included**.
- The element at the `end` index is **not included**.

#### **Another Slicing Example**
- To get elements from index `1` to `3`:
  ```python
  fam[1:4]  # Output: [1.80, "mom", 1.68]
  ```

## **3. Advanced Slicing Techniques**

### **Omitting Indices in Slicing**

#### **Omitting Start Index**
If you omit the `start` index, Python starts from index `0` by default.

**Example**:  
To get the first three elements:
```python
fam[:3]  # Output: ["dad", 1.80, "mom"]
```

#### **Omitting End Index**
If you omit the `end` index, Python includes all elements from the `start` index to the end of the list.

**Example**:  
To get all elements starting from index `2`:
```python
fam[2:]  # Output: ["mom", 1.68, "emma", 1.75, "brother", 1.72]
```

#### **Omitting Both Indices**
If you omit both indices, you get a **copy** of the entire list.

**Example**:  
```python
fam[:]  # Output: ["dad", 1.80, "mom", 1.68, "emma", 1.75, "brother", 1.72]
```

## **4. Key Points to Remember**

- **Indexing** starts from `0` for the first element and counts sequentially.
- **Negative indexing** starts from `-1` for the last element.
- **Slicing** creates a new list using a specified range of indices:  
  - The `start` index is **included**, and the `end` index is **not included**.
- Omitting the `start` or `end` index in slicing has specific default behaviors:
  - Omit `start`: Starts from index `0`.
  - Omit `end`: Includes all elements up to the last element.
  - Omit both: Returns a full copy of the list.
